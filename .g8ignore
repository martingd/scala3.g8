# Workaround to bug in Giter8.
#
# Having a
#   src/main/g8/.gitignore
# file in your template causes folders to be excluded when expanding the template.
#
# It seems te be caused by a bug in the library used to evaluate .gitignore.
#
# Details:
#   https://github.com/foundweekends/giter8/issues/401
#
# The workaround is to forcibly include the folder using this .g8ignore file in
# the root of the template project (not in the root of the template itself).
